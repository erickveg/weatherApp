As academics we get free access to the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/our-initiatives/student-initiative).

We get the benefits of the _Developer Plan_ for [current weather and forecasts](https://openweathermap.org/price#current) and the _Medium Plan_ for the [historical weather collection](https://openweathermap.org/price#history).

We will need to build our own data in Databricks using the API.

You have to fill out the request form to get access to the “Developer Plan” for Open Weather API for free as a student. If you don’t sign up, you get this error when trying to access it in your code:

```
{'cod': 401, 'message': 'Invalid API key. Please see https://openweathermap.org/faq#error401 for more info.'}
```

So just fill out the form at this site to get access: https://openweathermap.org/our-initiatives/student-initiative.   
Then you should see the Developer plan for Weather and Medium plan for History on the Services tab: https://home.openweathermap.org/myservices.
