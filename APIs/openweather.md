As academics we get free access to the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/our-initiatives/student-initiative).

We get the benefits of the _Developer Plan_ for [current weather and forecasts](https://openweathermap.org/price#current) and the _Medium Plan_ for the [historical weather collection](https://openweathermap.org/price#history).

You have to fill out the request form to get access to the “Developer Plan” for Open Weather API for free as a student. If you don’t sign up, you get this error when trying to access it in your code:

```
{'cod': 401, 'message': 'Invalid API key. Please see https://openweathermap.org/faq#error401 for more info.'}
```

So just fill out the form at this site to get access: https://openweathermap.org/our-initiatives/student-initiative.   
Then you should see the Developer plan for Weather and Medium plan for History on the Services tab: https://home.openweathermap.org/myservices.
